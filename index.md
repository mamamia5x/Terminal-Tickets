## Welcome to Terminal Tickets

Terminal Tickets is a ticket manager that is used compeletely in the terminal. All that is required is Node JS, there is no NPM used in this whatsoever. 

### How does it work?

It uses functions as commands. So if you want to add something, you'll say "add('text')" in the terminal, but it just calls the add function. 

This is still in development, so please wait ;)
